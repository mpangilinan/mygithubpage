        've worked as a Product Management Intern and IT Lab Technician, where I worked closely with people and designed solutions to fit their needs. Last winter I worked on some freelance IT projects with consultants and business analysts. What was interesting about these jobs and projects was that I worked with people to flesh out technical solutions on a higher level. I made high-fidelity mock-ups, wrote charters, and worked more on the client-facing and business side of tech problems.
      </p><p>
      This summer I wanted to gain more technical exposure and apply what I've learned in Computer Science courses in industry. I wanted to be on the engineering side of technical problem solving. Thus, my most recent adventure software engineering in the Denver Tech Center!
    </p>

    <p>My building blocks:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Java, Python, HTML/CSS,MySQL, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, C</li>
     <li>Git, Heroku, Maven, Tomcat, Jackson, Amazon EC2/Hadoop</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     If you would like a more formal summary of my work experience and projects, don't hesitate to contact me for further information or a copy of my resume.</p>
