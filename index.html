    <!--Brief Introduction-->
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            I am currently a fourth year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley
            studying <a href="http://ugis.ls.berkeley.edu/cogsci/">Cognitive Science</a> with a minor in
            Computer Science. I have big dreams of contributing towards the advancement of
            Artificial Intelligence, but until then I'm passionate about bridging the gap between
            people and technology in any way I can.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm currentlyÂ interested in software engineering and the applications of AI to everyday technology. This summer I interned at a telecommunications corporation where I applied Markov Decision Processes and Naive Bayes to analyze user habits to predict and suggest what users should watch (and when they should watch it).</p>

               <h2>work experience</h2>
               <p>
                   I've worked as a Product Management Intern and IT Lab Technician, where I worked closely with people and designed solutions to fit their needs. Last winter I worked on some freelance IT projects with consultants and business analysts. What was interesting about these jobs and projects was that I worked with people to flesh out technical solutions on a higher level. I made high-fidelity mock-ups, wrote charters, and worked more on the client-facing and business side of tech problems.
               </p><p>
               This summer I wanted to gain more technical exposure and apply what I've learned in Computer Science courses in industry. I wanted to be on the engineering side of technical problem solving. Thus, my most recent adventure software engineering in the Denver Tech Center!
